Total time taken by bot to complete the track and total score of team is calculated and recorded. The team which completes the given track in minimum time will win. The event has 2 rounds.\n\nScoring criteria (Round 1) :-\n1. In first round, wired and wireless bot have same scoring criteria.\n2. There are total 8 hurdles and after crossing each hurdle 10 points will be awarded.\n3. For skipping any hurdle, there is a penalty of 5 points. A team can skip maximum of 4 hurdles.\n4. For any human intervention, there is a penalty of 3 points.\n5. The team has to finish the race within 3 minutes.\n6. If any team has completed the race before the time limit then the remaining time (in seconds) is added to the total score of teams.\n7. If any team is not able to complete the race within the time limit, they can extend their limit by 20 seconds but corresponding points will be cut off from their scores.\n8. The team which still could not complete the race within 200 seconds (3 minutes+20 seconds) will directly be disqualified.\n\nScoring criteria (Round 2):-\n1. Wired and wireless bots have a little difference in scoring criteria.\n2. For Wired bot, the overall score achieved is multiplied by the factor of 1.3\nFor wireless bot, the overall score achieved is multiplied by the factor of 1.5\n3. There are mainly 6 technical hurdles and 3 non-technical hurdles within racing track.\n4. For crossing each technical hurdle by the bot, 10 points will be awarded.\nFor crossing each non-technical hurdle by the bot, 7 points will be awarded.\n5. Team can skip a maximum of 3 hurdles out of all hurdles in a run.\n6. Skipping of technical hurdles leads to penalty of 5 points and skipping of non-technical hurdles leads to penalty of 3 points.\n7. Total time given to participant team is maximum 6 minutes.\n8. If any team has complete the race before the time limit then the remaining time (in seconds) is added to the total score of teams.\n9. If any team is not able to complete the race within the time limit, they can extend their limit by 30 seconds but corresponding points will be cut off from their scores.\n10. The team which still could not complete the race within 390 seconds ( 6 minutes+ 30 seconds) will be directly disqualified.\n11. There is a penalty of 3 points for any human interventions introduced in race.\n12.

For wireless bot, team should on board power supply and a dual frequency remote.\n6. Voltage difference between any two terminals or path is not to be greater than 12 V.\n7.
